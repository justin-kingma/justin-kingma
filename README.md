# Hi, I’m Justin 👋

I’m a Support Engineer with a background spanning robotics, systems, and web development.  
My experience ranges from troubleshooting complex hardware/software in advanced robotics to helping teams adopt modern digital tools.  

Lately, I’ve been expanding my skills in web development, with a focus on clean, accessible, and user-centered design. I enjoy problem-solving, learning new technologies, and contributing to projects that make an impact.
